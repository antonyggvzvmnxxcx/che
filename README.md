https://www.eclipse.org/che/. Next-generation container development platform, developer workspace server and cloud IDE. Che is Kubernetes-native and places everything the developer needs into containers in Kube pods including dependencies, embedded containerized runtimes, a web IDE, and project code. This makes workspaces distributed, collaborative, and portable to run anywhere Kubernetes runs ... [Read More](https://www.eclipse.org/che/features/)

### Getting Started
You can run Che wherever Kubernetes runs - in the public cloud, a private cloud, or install it locally. The [step by step guide](https://eclipse.org/che/getting-started/) will get you going along with [our docs](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/).


### Customizing
Customizing Che could be done in several ways:

1. **Customize the dashboard for your team to start coding on your projects.**

   Developers would access to the dashboard with your own devfiles to create on demand workspaces. Each devfile could have a deep level of customization:
    - Import any git projects
    - Use plugins that you have coded or the ones available from the Che plugin registry or VSCode market place or your own hosted plugin registry.
    - Include your build time or runtime containers, your kube native applications.
    - Make available customized commands to build and run your projects.
2. **Customize your own Che-theia editor with your own set of build in plugins and make it the default editor of your Che deployment.**
3. **Customize and run your own editor instead of Che-Theia.**
